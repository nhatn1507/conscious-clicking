Beware of suspicious-looking emails and their hyperlinks. This can be served as an aftermath of clicking a suspicious link included in suspicious emails, to show people it's very harmful to do so.

It's common practice for digital scammers to change their sender-display name to those of authorities, such as "Bank of America Alerts" and send out emails like the one below, in which they disguise link to virus or harmful websites under bankofamerica.com. Unwary receivers might click the click bait and get their device and privacy compromised.
