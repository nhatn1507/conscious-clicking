<h1 style='color: blue;'>You clicked "the bait"!</h1>
<h4>***You clicked a link sent by a random "sketchy" person***</h4>
  <div> 
<ul>Behind the link that you clicked, there could be:
  <li> Virus: which you would automatically download. Imagine I am in control of your computer right now, with all your personal info, photos, etc. After you click that email, I could have looked at you through your webcam, or listen to you, anytime I want. Now stop imagining. That could have been a reality if I desire so. </li>
  <li> R (restricted) site: You could have been directed to a site which houses content of frequent strong language and violence, nudity for sexual purposes, and drug abuse. That might be harmful for children of 17 years old or younger, i.e. your children. </li>
</ul>
    </div>
<h3 style='font-style: italic'> One wrong click might lead you astray. </h3>

<h3 style='color: blue;'> So, how could you avoid this? </h3>
<div> 
<p> 
  <ol>
    <li> Go back to the spoof email. The sender's name appears to be "Bank of America Alerts", <span style='color:red; font-weight: bold;'> which anyone who has an email can change their name to. </span></li>
    <li> Look at the greeting "Dear <span style='text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; font-size: 1.2em;'> customer</span>": it seems the sender doesn't even know your name. </li>
    <li> In the email body, there's also "<span style='font-weight: bold'>Your last sign-in was 12/01/2017.</span>" Is this even true? </li>
</ol>
 </p>

</div>
    <h1> Remember, know what you are clicking yourself into! :)</h1>
